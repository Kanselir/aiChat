# PhysiPal - Your AI Physics Assistant

This is a Next.js application bootstrapped with Firebase Studio, designed to be an AI-powered assistant for physics learning.

## Features

*   **Interactive Chat:** Ask PhysiPal general physics questions or ask for explanations on concepts.
*   **Practice Problems:** Switch to Practice Mode to get physics problems generated by AI, submit your answers, and receive immediate feedback.
*   **Homework Help:** Use Homework Mode to type in your physics problems or upload an image of your assignment for AI-assisted solutions and explanations.

## Getting Started

The main application logic is within `src/app/page.tsx`, which renders the `PhysiPalChat` component located in `src/components/physipal/PhysiPalChat.tsx`.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or your configured port) with your browser to see the result.

## AI Integration

This application utilizes Genkit AI flows located in `src/ai/flows` for:

*   Solving physics problems from text input (`solve-physics-problem-from-text.ts`).
*   Solving physics problems from image input (`solve-physics-problem-from-image.ts`).
*   Generating feedback on practice problem answers (`generate-practice-problem-feedback.ts`).

Make sure you have your Google AI API key configured in your environment variables (`GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`).
