## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#29ABE2) for a scientific and trustworthy feel.
- Secondary color: White (#FFFFFF) for clean content presentation.
- Background color: Black (#000000) or a very dark gray for contrast and a modern look.
- Accent: Yellow (#FFDA63) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Responsive design with a clear separation of chat area, input fields, and mode selection.
- Use physics-related icons (e.g., atoms, equations) for visual appeal.
- Subtle animations for loading states and transitions between modes.
